### just a repo to test out hugo on gh-pages

This is basically just the repo here: [https://github.com/spencerlyon2/hugo_gh_blog](https://github.com/spencerlyon2/hugo_gh_blog), deployed with hugo following (except the bits which were wrong) the tutorial here: [https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/).

This repo will be deleted soon, once I set up a proper page, but for now you can see it at: [http://goldingn.github.io/hugo_test/](http://goldingn.github.io/hugo_test/).
